TextEimer
=========

A clipboard application providing a short usable history of windows clipboard texts. It extends the functionality for windows clipboard (texts only) and supports programmers with additional features.

Work is still in Progress so it is not usable yet. You can use the inferior, bad coded version Clip: https://github.com/Budgegeria/Clip
