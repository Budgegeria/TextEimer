Starting TextEimer
------------------
This software doesn't need to be installed. Put the TextEimer.exe into your preffered directory and 
start it. After starting TextEimer a bucket icon is shown in the tray. With a right click on the 
icon a contextmenu opens with elements for options and exiting TextEimer.
After copying a text it is also is available in the contextmenu. By clicking in 
it or pressing enter after you selected a clipboard item in contextmenu, 
the selected text is pasted to the software which had the focus before opening the 
contextmenu of TextEimer right into the cursors position.

Hotkeys
-------
After starting TextEimer you can use the following hotkeys:

**Win + v**  
Opens the contextmenu of TextEimer next to your mouse cursor.

**Shift + Enter**  
After selecting one of the items from contextmenu this hotkey puts the selected text into 
clipboard without pasting it.

**Del**  
deletes a selected item in contextmenu (in case you copied a password)

TODO
----
* Code-Snippets
   * Adding own text parts where the clipboard value is set in between and pasted
* Setting contextmenu position in options

suggestions are welcome.
